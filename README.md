# PDS

**This is NOT the official Bluesky PDS, for that see
[bluesky/pds](https://github.com/bluesky/pds)**

This repository contains a flavor of the Bluesky PDS. As of this writing
it's largely just more up-to-date than the official. Latest versions of
the reference (`@atproto/pds`) are used over hand-picked versions.

## Usage

Follow the [official PDS documentation](https://github.com/bluesky/pds),
using the installer and resources provided in this repository instead.

### Switching from bluesky/pds

### Switching the Installer Back

To switch back to the official installer, simply replace the `pdsadmin`
script on your machine to be the official one and run `sudo pdsadmin
update`.
